# Installation
* Using the cmd might be good. But I want you download Bash and use it on this case.
* Type git clone https://github.com/locotami/ReactionSpeed
* Now I want you to make sure that Node.js is installed so copy and paste this npm install -g http-server
* Type http-server to start the server on your directory (I forgot, I haven't finished the scoreplot yet so this would be nonsense. Ignore this for now)


# Note: Not Yet Complied

I haven't compiled the app into a .exe file yet so starting would be a bit too troublesome. What I want you to do instead is to just run the app on vs code.

# Gameplay Tutorial

Assuming that you have started it on vs code already. The mechanics of the game might be confusing but it's not that hard once played. I referenced the game OSU for this so you have to consider this factors.

* Pointing the mouse cursor then pressing wasd keys
* w if arrow is pointing up
* d if arrow is pointing right
* s if arrow is pointing down
* a if arrow is pointing left

Which means that you have to first point at the circle (NOT THE ARROW) and start pressing the wasd keys or else the game will end (it has a limit of 2 secs so you must be fast).

# Scoring System

You have to consider two things for the scoring system
* Reaction Speed (depending on how fast you pressed the right key in milliseconds)
* Accuracy (Depending on how accurate you pointed at the midpoint of the circle)

# Score Plot (Not yet Finished)

I haven't finished the javascript file for this one, although you can run it already, I want it to open the leaderboard once the game was finished. I forgot also to add the css file
